It allows you to quickly check for the presence of files or directories in
order to detect potential flaws in the way the web server is configured.

Why DirDuster?
==============

The main tool used for this task is DirBuster_ which is written in Java and
uses a graphical interface. This makes it hard enough to use for me to prefer
writting another tool with a more proper interface.

There also exist dirb_ but it doesn't allow the user to specify the number of
threads which means a massive slowdown on my machine which wasn't acceptable
anymore.
